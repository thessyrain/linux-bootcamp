# PRACTICE LAB I: CREATE A LINUX VIRTUAL MACHINE WITH THE AZURE CLI
  1. Lanuch Microsoft Azure Cloud Shell (Free Subcription)
  2. Create a resource (UBUNTU SERVER )
  3. I deployed with Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS, this is the leading Linux
     in public cloud with > 50% of LINUX WORKLOADS.
  4. Created a Virtual Machine with the IP address of 20.121.192.135 with
     the following steps;
# PROJECT DETAILS
     a. Created a resource group with the name THESSYRAIN_NG
# INSTANCE DETAILS
     b. Filled in a name for the VM  as Webserver1
     c. There are different regions available, i stuck with  (US) East US
     d. I chose Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS- GEN 1 for my image
     e. To select the Size of my VM I chose DS1_v2 General purpose EAST  
        REGION with CPU 1, 3.5GB RAM, Data disk 4 and Max IOPS 3200 and
        Temporary Storage of 7 GiB
# ADMINISTRATOR ACCOUNT
Authentication type:  f. I selected Password, I couldnt SSH into my Kali terminal, so i download putty gen to access my webserver
      g. Password: I created a Username and Password to help access the ppk with the IP address created for the VM
# PUBLIC INBOUND PORTS
      h. Allowed for selected for port, HTTP (80) and SSH (22)
# INSTALL WEB SERVER
       a. on my kali terminal i ran the command line sudo apt-get update
       b. sudo apt-get install apache2
       c. systemctl status apache2   it reads active running
       d. to test i copied the IP address and google searched it.
